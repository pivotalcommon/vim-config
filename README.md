# The Pivotal vim-config has moved

It is now located at [https://github.com/pivotal/vim-config](https://github.com/pivotal/vim-config).

## Upgrading

If you have an existing installation of this vim-config, you can automatically migrate by running the `update` script twice.

```
$ ~/.vim/bin/update
$ ~/.vim/bin/update
```

Alternatively, you can completely delete `~/.vim` and reinstall the new vim-config from scratch by following its [installation instructions](https://github.com/pivotal/vim-config#to-install).
